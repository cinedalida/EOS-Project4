Sprint Data Automation - Context & Overview

What This Automation Does:
This Google Apps Script automatically connects to your Typeform surveys, 
fetches all response data, and transforms it into organized, actionable insights in Google Sheets. 
It eliminates manual data export/import processes and creates a centralized dashboard for tracking 
sprint feedback across multiple iterations.

What It Creates:

Raw Data Sheet: Complete backup of all Typeform responses with full API data
Processed Data Sheet: Clean, normalized data with dynamic columns matching your form questions
Dashboard: Real-time summary statistics including total responses, completion rates, and date ranges
Mega Dataset: Aggregated cross-sprint data for longitudinal analysis
Custom Menu: One-click interface for data updates and report generation

What It Generates:

Automated daily data sync from Typeform API
Dynamic reports adapting to your form structure
Key performance metrics (response rates, completion statistics)
Historical trend analysis across multiple sprints
Error handling and connection monitoring

Business Value & Usefulness:

Time Savings: Eliminates manual data export/import (saves 15-30 minutes per sprint)
Real-Time Insights: Always current data without manual updates
Scalability: Handles growing response volumes automatically
Data Integrity: Consistent formatting and no human export errors
Historical Analysis: Built-in cross-sprint comparison capabilities
Accessibility: Team members can access latest data anytime via Google Sheets
Automation: Set-and-forget daily updates with error notifications

==================================================================

üéØ Current Scope: Single Survey Focus
Yes, the current automation is designed for ONE Typeform survey at a time.
Here's what it does:
javascriptconst CONFIG = {
  FORM_ID: 'YOUR_FORM_ID_HERE',  // ‚Üê ONE specific form
  // ...
};

‚úÖ Connects to one specific Typeform (defined by FORM_ID)
‚úÖ Fetches all responses from that single survey
‚úÖ Creates sheets for that one survey's data

üìä What "Mega Dataset" Actually Means

Different runs/iterations of the same survey
Historical data from the same form over time
NOT data from multiple different surveys

üîÑ Multi-Survey Limitations
What it CAN'T do currently:

‚ùå Pull from multiple different Typeform surveys simultaneously
‚ùå Combine data from different forms with different questions
‚ùå Switch between different surveys automatically

In Progress

Multi-Survey Expansion Options

Option 1: Multiple Configurations (Simple)
javascriptconst SURVEYS = {
  SPRINT_FEEDBACK: { token: 'xxx', formId: 'abc123' },
  ONBOARDING: { token: 'xxx', formId: 'def456' },
  EXIT_INTERVIEW: { token: 'xxx', formId: 'ghi789' }
};
Option 2: Survey Selector Menu

Add dropdown menu to choose which survey to process
Each survey gets its own set of sheets

Option 3: Multi-Survey Dashboard

Combine data from related surveys
Cross-survey analytics and comparisons
