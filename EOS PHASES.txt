PHASE 1: Setup & Dummy Data Generation (Current Phase)
Step 1.1: Create Your Typeform Survey

 Go to Typeform.com and create the survey using the questions I provided earlier
 Test the survey manually (submit 1-2 responses yourself)
 Note your Form ID from the URL: typeform.com/to/YOUR_FORM_ID
 
 (Link: https://form.typeform.com/to/mBV59eh0)

Step 1.2: Generate Dummy Data via Browser Automation

 Open your Typeform survey's public URL (respondent view)
 Open Browser Developer Tools (F12 → Console tab)
 First, run the element inspection code:

    (Paste ConsoleTest.js)

 Based on the output, customize and run the full automation script
 Generate 20-30 dummy responses across 3-4 different sprint names
 Verify responses are showing up in Typeform's Results section

Step 1.3: Get Typeform API Access

 In Typeform, go to Account Settings → Personal Tokens
 Click "Generate a new token"
 Give it a name like "Sprint Data Automation"
 Select scopes: "Read responses" and "Read forms"
 Save the token securely - you'll need it for Google Apps Script


PHASE 2: Google Sheets Setup
Step 2.1: Create Your Google Sheets Structure

Create 3 separate sheets in one Google Sheets file:
Sheet 1: "Dashboard" (Master Tracking)
| Sprint Name | Total Responses | CSV Link | PowerPoint Link | Last Updated | Status |
Sheet 2: "Raw Data" (Individual responses)
| Timestamp | Learner Name | Sprint Name | Overall Rating | Engagement Score | ... |
Sheet 3: "Mega Dataset" (Aggregated insights)
| Sprint Name | Avg Overall | Avg Engagement | Total Responses | Key Insights | Completion Date |
Step 2.2: Set Up Google Apps Script


PHASE 3: Google Apps Script Development
Step 3.1: Basic Typeform Connection
Step 3.2: Data Processing Functions
Step 3.3: Add Custom Menu for One-Click Execution
(Paste AppsScript.js)

PHASE 4: Integration & Testing
Step 4.1: End-to-End Testing

 Run the Google Apps Script to fetch your dummy data
 Verify data appears correctly in Google Sheets
 Test the dashboard updates
 Check the mega dataset aggregation

Step 4.2: Error Handling & Edge Cases

 Test with empty responses
 Test with special characters in text
 Test API rate limiting
 Add try-catch blocks for robust error handling


PHASE 5: Automation & Scheduling
Step 5.1: Set Up Triggers

 In Apps Script, go to Triggers (clock icon)
 Add time-driven trigger to run daily/weekly
 Set up form submit trigger (if available)

Step 5.2: Final Testing

 Test the complete automated pipeline
 Create documentation for end users
 Set up notification system for errors
